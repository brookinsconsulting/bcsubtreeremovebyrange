FAQ

1. This extension created in response to the need to remove content tree node
subtree(s) by a range of NodeID start and end IDs

- The admin2 design is presently by default limited to removing nodes in pagination default
limits of 50 at a time.

- The default eZ Publish command line script to remove content tree node subtrees
requires you specify NodeIDs in a comma separated list.

1.1. This solution provides a script based on the above script but which only requires
you specify the start and end NodeIDs.

- The script calculates the range of NodeIDs from starting NodeID to ending NodeID
and removes the node subtrees using the same logic as the above default script.

As mentioned throughout the documentation this script is based on the
eZ Publish default command line script, './bin/php/ezsubtreeremove.php'


2. This extension was created in response to a need to remove subtrees
of content tree nodes quickly and effectively.

IE: Not 50 at a time in admin2 or by specific NodeID using default scripts provided

2.1 The actual content tree nodes created in a range were created automatically
in order (ie: no other site activity) by the bcloremipsum extension, http://projects.ez.no/bcloremipsum
